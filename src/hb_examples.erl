%% @doc Start a node running the simple pay meta device, and use it to relay
%% a message for a client. We must ensure:
%% 1. When the client has no balance, the relay fails.
%% 2. The operator is able to topup for the client.
%% 3. The client has the correct balance after the topup.
%% 4. The relay succeeds when the client has enough balance.
%% 5. The received message is signed by the host using http-sig and validates
%%    correctly.

%% @doc Gain signed WASM responses from a node and verify them.
%% 1. Start the client with a small balance.
%% 2. Execute a simple WASM function on the host node.
%% 3. Verify the response is correct and signed by the host node.
%% 4. Get the balance of the client and verify it has been deducted.
